MESSAGEix-GLOBIOM documentation
===============================

These pages document the IIASA Integrated Assessment Modeling (IAM) framework, also referred to as |MESSAGEix|-GLOBIOM, owing to the fact that the energy model |MESSAGEix| and the land use model GLOBIOM are its most important components.
|MESSAGEix|-GLOBIOM was developed for the quantification of the so-called Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) which are the first application of the IAM framework.

**This documentation is under constant development and is being expanded with additional information to reflect the latest changes in the modeling framework.**

The |MESSAGEix|-GLOBIOM Integrated Assessment Model is based on the |MESSAGEix| framework, an open-source energy systems optimization modelling environment including macro-economic feedback using a stylized computable general equilibrium model.
When referring to the software underpinning |MESSAGEix|-GLOBIOM rather than the data or specific assessments, please see the :ref:`“User guidelines and notice” section <message_ix:notice-cite>` of the documentation, which indicates to use at least the following citation:
