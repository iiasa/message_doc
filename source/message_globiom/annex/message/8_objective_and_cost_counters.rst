8 Objective and Cost Counters
=============================

8.1 	Constraints
---------------------

8.1.1 	Cost Accounting Rows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The different types of costs (i.e. entries for the objective function) can be accumulated  over all technologies in built-in  accounting rows. These rows can be generated per period or for the whole horizon and contain the sum of the undiscounted costs. They can also be limited. The implemented types are:

.. list-table:: 
   :widths: 40 110
   :header-rows: 0

   * - :math:`CCUR`
     - fix (related to the installed capacity) and variable (related to the production) operation and maintenance costs,
   * - :math:`CCAP`
     - investment costs; if the investments of a technology are distributed over the previous periods, also the entries to this accounting rows are distributed (if the capital costs are levellized, the total payments in a period can be taken from :math:`CINV`; :math:`CCAP` shows the share of investments in the according period, then),
   * - :math:`CRES`
     - domestic fuel costs,
   * - :math:`CAR1`
     - costs related to the user defined relations of type 1 (see section 7), 
   * - :math:`CAR2`
     - costs related to the user defined relations of type 2 (see section 7),
   * - :math:`CRED`
     - costs for reducing demands due to demand elasticities, only related to technologies supplying the demands directly,
   * - :math:`CIMP`
     - import costs,
   * - :math:`CEXP`
     - gains for export, and
   * - :math:`CINV`
     - total investments (in case of levellized investment costs, see :math:`CCAP`).


8.1.2 	The Objective Function
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. math::
   FUNC

In its usual form the objective function contains the sum of all discounted costs, i.e. all kinds of costs that can be accounted for. All costs related to operation (i.e. resource use, operation costs, costs of demand elasticities,...) are discounted from the middle of the current period to the first year. Costs related to construction are by default discounted from the beginning of the current period to the first year. By using the facility of distributing the investments or accounting during construction these costs can be distributed over some periods before or equal to the current one (see section 10.2). This distribution can also be performed  for user defined relations.

The objective function has the following general form:

.. math::
   \sum_t\left [ \beta_m^t \Delta t\left \{ \sum_{svd}\sum_lzsvd..lt\times\epsilon_{svd}\times\left [ ccur(svd,t)+\sum_i\sum_mro_{svd}^{mlt}\times cari(ml,t)\right ]+ \sum_{svd}\epsilon_{svd}\times\sum_{e=0}^{e_d}Usvd.e.t\times\epsilon_{svd}\times\left [ \kappa _e\times(ccur(svd,t)+\sum_mro_{svd}^{mt}\times car2(m,t)) +  cred(d,e)+\sum_mro_{svd}^{mt}\times car1(m,t) \right ] +\sum_{svd}\sum_{\tau =t-\tau_{svd}}^t\Delta\tau\times Yzsvd..\tau\times cfix(svd,\tau)+  \sum_r \left [\sum_g\sum_l\sum_pRzrgp.lt\times cres(rgpl,t)+  \sum_c\sum_l\sum_pIzrcp.lt\times cimp(rcpl,t) -\sum_c\sum_l\sum_p Ezrcp.lt\times cexp(rcpl,t) \right ] \right \} + \beta_b^t\times\left \{ \sum_{svd}\sum_{\tau=t}^{t+t_d}\Delta(t-1)\times Yzsvd..\tau\times\left [ ccap(svd,\tau)\times fri_{svd}^{t_d-\tau}+  \sum_i\sum_mrc_{svd}^{mt} \times cari(m,t)\times fra_{svd,m}^{t_d-\tau} \right ] \right \} \right ]
